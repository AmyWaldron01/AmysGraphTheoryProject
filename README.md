<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello my name is Amy Waldron. 
This notebook's objective is to illustrate my comprehension and learning results from the ATU curriculum on Graph Theory for software development.</p>

<h2>Module</h2>
<h4>Graph theory</h4>
<p1>Graph theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures consisting of vertices and edges. 
 I will be using graph theory to help explain the contents of this notebook which revolves around Graph Isomorphism.
