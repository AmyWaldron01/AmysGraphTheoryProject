<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello my name is Amy Waldron. 
This notebook's objective is to illustrate my comprehension and learning results from the ATU curriculum on Graph Theory for software development.</p>

<h2>Module</h2>
<h4>Graph theory</h4>
<p1>Graph theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of graphs, which are mathematical structures consisting of vertices and edges. 
 I will be using graph theory to help explain the contents of this notebook which revolves around Graph Isomorphism.
</p1>

<h3> Running the application </h3>
<p>Clone the Rep as Follows<br>

```
git clone https://github.com/AmyWaldron01/AmysGraphTheoryProject.git
```

<br>

Open up your terminal at the right location:

```
cd project
```

now do

```
code .
```
and it will open the ibyn file in visual studio code. (you also may run this file using Jupyter notebook)
Images are only displayed in Visual Studio code!!
